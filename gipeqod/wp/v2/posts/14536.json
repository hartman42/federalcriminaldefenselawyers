The common law principle of&nbsp;\u201ccastle doctrine\u201d states that if an intruder breaks into your home, you can stand your ground and do what is reasonably necessary to protect yourself or your family from harm. This includes using physical force to protect another person who is in danger or even killing someone who is threatening your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to this law is that you are only permitted to use the amount of force that is reasonably necessary to defend yourself. For instance, if you see someone outside your home and run outside and shoot them, your actions may not be justified, depending on the specific facts of the case. However, if someone breaks into your home, California\u2019s self-defense laws state that you have the right to take action to maintain your safety, including using deadly force, without retreating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"your-right-to-protect-your-property-in-california\">Your Right to Protect Your Property in California<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under most circumstances, California law would prohibit the use of force against another person. However, if an intruder forcibly enters your home, California Penal Code 198.5 PC, the state\u2019s&nbsp;\u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d automatically presumes that you, the resident, would have a reasonable fear of death or great bodily injury from the intruder. In this case, you would be justified in using deadly force to defend yourself or your property. This is known as justifiable homicide and is not considered a crime under California law. Still, if you find yourself in this situation, it would be wise to consult a knowledgeable&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/hire-federal-lawyer\/\">criminal lawyer<\/a>&nbsp;who can explain your rights and help you establish a strong legal defense using California\u2019s self-defense laws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"when-is-it-considered-self-defense\">When is it Considered Self-Defense?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you are facing criminal charges in San Diego for using deadly force to defend yourself against an imminent threat, you may be able to use self-defense as a legal defense if:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You reasonably believed that you or your loved ones were in imminent danger or your lives were at risk;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You reasonably believed that using deadly force was necessary to defend yourself or your family against that threat; and<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You used no more force than was reasonably necessary to protect yourself or others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, it is up to the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you&nbsp;<em>did not<\/em>&nbsp;act in self-defense. We highly recommend hiring a knowledgeable criminal defense attorney who can fight for you and present evidence supporting the argument that you acted in self-defense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"is-california-a-stand-your-ground-state\">Is California a&nbsp;\u201cStand Your Ground\u201d State?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, California is a&nbsp;\u201cstand your ground\u201d state. Stand your ground laws generally establish a person\u2019s right to stay put and defend themselves and their family members against an intruder they believe may cause them harm, even if it might have been possible to retreat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"do-i-have-a-duty-to-retreat\">Do I Have a Duty to Retreat?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In deciding whether self-defense is a valid defense in your criminal case, the court will consider whether you had a \u201dreasonable fear of imminent harm,\u201d meaning you feared for your life and the threat had to be dealt with immediately. In this situation, there is no duty to retreat before using force to eliminate that threat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"free-san-diego-criminal-defense-consultation\">Free San Diego Criminal Defense Consultation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone forcibly entered your home and you injured or killed that person in self-defense, it is in your best interest to speak to a reputable criminal defense attorney as soon as possible.
