During the arraignment, the court will present the charges against you and explain your rights, and you will respond to the charges by entering a plea of guilty, not guilty, or no contest (also known as&nbsp;\u201cnolo contendere\u201d).

It is a formal court proceeding; if you fail to appear, the court will issue a bench warrant for your arrest and you could face additional criminal charges. During your arraignment, the court will formally charge you with a crime and inform you of your rights and you will enter an initial plea in your case. The following are the most common types of pleas in a California criminal case:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guilty:<\/strong>&nbsp;Pleading guilty means admitting that you committed the alleged crime. If you plead guilty, the judge will find you guilty and enter a conviction in the court record.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not Guilty:<\/strong>&nbsp;If you plead not guilty, you are stating that you did not commit the alleged crime. In some cases, a not guilty plea may lead to a plea bargain, or it could mean your case goes to trial, where the prosecution will be forced to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No Contest (nolo contendere):<\/strong>&nbsp;A plea of no contest means you do not disagree with the charge. Pleading guilty or no contest has essentially the same result, except a no contest plea cannot be used against you in a civil lawsuit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-happens-after-the-arraignment\"><strong>What Happens After the Arraignment?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are in custody at the time of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sandiegoduilawyers.com\/san-diego-dui-attorney\/\"><u>arraignment<\/u><\/a>, once you enter your plea, one of three things will happen, depending on the circumstances of your case: the judge will release you with orders to return to court on a specified date; the judge will set bail and send you back to jail until bail is posted; or the judge will refuse to set bail and send you back to jail pending the outcome of your case. According to California Penal Code \u00a71275(a)(1), the court\u2019s main considerations in setting, reducing, or denying bail are:&nbsp;\u201cthe protection of the public, the seriousness of the offense charged, the previous criminal record of the defendant, and the probability of his or her appearing at trial or at a hearing of the case.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"when-to-accept-a-plea-bargain\">When to Accept a Plea Bargain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sandiegoduilawyers.com\/san-diego-dui-attorney\/\"><u>arrested and charged with a crime<\/u><\/a>&nbsp;in San Diego, you may be expecting your case to go to trial. However, the majority of criminal cases in California are resolved through plea bargaining. A plea bargain is a legal agreement between the defendant and the prosecutor in which the defendant agrees to plead guilty to one or more charges in return for certain concessions from the prosecutor. Some examples of possible concessions include dismissing one or more charges, reducing a charge to a less serious offense, or making a lighter sentence recommendation to the court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"pros-and-cons-of-a-plea-bargain\"><strong>Pros and Cons of a Plea Bargain<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plea bargaining can be an effective tool for resolving a criminal case quickly and efficiently. When faced with a criminal charge, a plea bargain can help you avoid a long, drawn-out trial, saving you both time and expense. It can also result in a less serious charge, a reduced sentence, or no sentence at all. Finally, a plea bargain gives both the prosecution and defense some sense of control over the outcome of the case, compared to a trial, which can be unpredictable. That being said, accepting a plea bargain is not always in the defendant\u2019s best interest. By doing so, you are effectively admitting guilt, and that can come with serious collateral consequences you must carefully consider. Only by consulting a skilled criminal defense attorney can you know whether to accept a plea bargain or take your case to trial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-common-is-plea-bargaining\"><strong>How Common is Plea Bargaining?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The criminal justice system in the United States is notoriously encumbered. Trials can take weeks or even months to conclude, and with the courts facing significant backlogs of criminal cases, judges and prosecutors are encouraged to move cases through the system as quickly as they can. As such, plea bargaining has become very common in criminal cases in California and across the U.S. In fact, while there are no exact statistics documenting the proportion of criminal cases that are resolved through plea bargaining, reports estimate that more than 90% of federal and state court cases end in a plea bargain. That means less than 10% of criminal cases go to trial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"free-san-diego-criminal-defense-consultation\">Free San Diego Criminal Defense Consultation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot stress enough how important it is to have a knowledgeable legal representative on your side when facing a criminal charge in San Diego.
