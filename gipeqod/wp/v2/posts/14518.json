In some cases, the prosecuting attorney may offer the defendant a plea deal, which means the defendant will receive some kind of concession, usually a reduced charge or punishment, in exchange for pleading guilty or nolo contendere (no contest). If the defendant is offered a plea deal and accepts, a judge will dole out the sentence without a trial. If the defendant wants to fight the charges and pleads not guilty, the case will go to trial, where a judge or jury will decide the verdict.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"going-to-trial-vs-accepting-a-plea-deal\">Going to Trial vs Accepting a Plea Deal<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the specifics of your criminal case, accepting a plea deal from the DA may be the best way to resolve your case and avoid a more serious punishment. In others, you may be better off taking your chances at trial. To know whether to accept a plea or go to trial, you must assess the pros and cons of each option. For instance, by making a plea agreement instead of going to trial, you have the benefit of predictability concerning the outcome of your case (i.e. your sentence). On the other hand, accepting a plea offer means you will most definitely gain a criminal record. You will also be giving up your right to challenge the charges or go to trial.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"section-1\"><\/h3>\n<h3 id=\"when-going-to-trial-makes-sense\">When Going to Trial Makes Sense<\/h3>\n<p>Considering the predictability that comes with taking a plea, choosing to go to trial and putting your case in the hands of a judge or jury may seem like a risky move. And in some cases, it can be. Trials are unpredictable and you have no way of knowing whether the judge or jury will decide in your favor. However, if you are truly innocent of the crime you have been accused of committing and you want justice, going to trial and fighting for a better outcome may be in your best interest. This is especially true if the DA is not offering a reasonable plea deal. Perhaps the DA is overcharging, or maybe there is a crime you did commit and you want to negotiate a plea deal on that charge, but the DA is also charging you with other crimes you didn\u2019t commit. In this case, taking your case to trial may result in some of these charges being dismissed, or the sentencing from the judge may be better than the sentence the DA is offering, even if you lose at trial.<\/p>\n<p>A trial may also be the best choice for you if your attorney feels the prosecution\u2019s case is weak and you have a strong defense strategy in place. The most obvious benefit of going to trial is the possibility of obtaining a not-guilty verdict and having your case dismissed with no criminal liability. The potential downside is being found guilty and facing serious criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"section-2\"><\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"free-san-diego-criminal-defense-consultation\">Free San Diego Criminal Defense Consultation<\/h2>\n<p>If you are facing criminal charges in San Diego, you should meet with an experienced criminal defense lawyer as soon as possible.
