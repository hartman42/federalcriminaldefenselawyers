At the same time that the government was doling out funds to borrowers, it was also putting in place the systems of oversight and enforcement it needed to vigorously investigate and prosecute fraud related to these federal aid programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program.<\/p>\n<p>In a memo to the DOJ in March, the Attorney General called for federal prosecutors to \u201cprioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of all criminal conduct related to the current pandemic.\u201d Then, in May, just two short months after the CARES Act was signed into law, the DOJ filed the first fraud charges in connection with the CARES Act. A wave of fraud investigations and criminal charges followed and this aggressive enforcement activity by the federal government is expected to continue with vigor.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Government Thoroughly Reviewing CARES Act Applications<\/h2>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time accepting government funds caused borrowers to be subjected to heightened scrutiny, federal investigations and criminal charges. In 2008, in response to the financial crisis in the United States, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA), which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a $700 billion bailout program. This was followed in 2009 by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), an $800 billion stimulus package. Together, these two relief programs distributed roughly $1.4 trillion in government funds, and an unintended consequence of these measures was a high potential for fraud.<\/p>\n<p>To combat fraudulent activity related to the aid programs, the government created a separate law enforcement agency to investigate allegations of fraud by recipients of TARP funds (Special Inspector General for TARP, or SIGTARP) and a Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board tasked with investigating fraud and abuse. By the end of 2019, 430 individuals had been charged with crimes ranging from bank fraud and mortgage fraud to false statements, money laundering and bankruptcy fraud, 373 were convicted and 291 were sentenced to prison.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Potential CARES Act Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>Now, with billions of dollars in government funds at stake, federal investigators and lenders are carefully reviewing CARES Act loan applications and supporting documentation for any potential fraudulent activity, which could trigger a federal investigation and potential criminal charges. In fact, the government has created a similar Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) and Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, whose job it is to \u201cconduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations\u201d in connection with the CARES Act. The charges being pursued by the federal government against those accused of committing or conspiring to commit CARES Act fraud include the following white-collar crimes:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/bankruptcy-fraud\/\"><strong>Bank Fraud \u2013 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1344<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most common crimes being charged in connection with CARES Act fraud is bank fraud. According to 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1344, bank fraud occurs any time a person knowingly uses false or fraudulent pretenses, promises or representations in order to execute, or attempt to execute, a scheme with the intent to defraud a financial institution or obtain any money, funds, assets, securities or other property owned by or under the control of a financial institution.

The potential punishment for mail fraud includes a fine and a term of imprisonment not to exceed 20 years.

Even if you didn\u2019t actually obtain funds under the CARES Act, you could be at risk for criminal prosecution under the federal conspiracy statute if you are accused of conspiring to commit CARES Act fraud. If you or someone you know has been charged with bank fraud, wire fraud or another federal crime in connection with the CARES Act, or if you believe you may be the target of a federal fraud investigation, consult a skilled federal criminal defense attorney right away. A good defense attorney can ensure that your rights are protected and make the best possible legal decisions on your behalf, whether that involves responding to a target letter, negotiating with federal prosecutors or fighting the charges in court.

There is a common misconception among borrowers that allegations of CARES Act fraud involving less than $2 million will not be pursued by federal investigators. However, you can believe that the government will go after all individuals and businesses suspected of committing or conspiring to commit fraud. If you applied for or obtained government funds under the CARES Act, you could be at risk for a potential audit, criminal investigation and legal action by the Department of Justice and its partner agencies. <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/what-are-the-penalties-if-you-are-convicted-in-federal-court\/\">Contact our reputable fraud defense lawyers at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers<\/a> as soon as possible to discuss your case and determine the best legal strategy based on your specific situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers<\/strong><br \/>\n3500 Fifth Avenue,<br \/>\nSuite 203,<br \/>\nSan Diego, CA 92103<br \/>\n<a href=\"tel:1-855-569-7300\" data-ctm-watch-id=\"7\" data-ctm-tracked=\"1\">(855) 569-7300<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The federal government is cracking down on fraud, false statements and other white-collar crimes associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill signed into law in March 2020 to provide immediate financial relief to American families, workers and small businesses affected by the coronavirus crisis.
