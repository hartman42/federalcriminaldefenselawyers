Unfortunately, while the law demands this presumption of innocence in every criminal case, society as a whole tends to assume the worst of those accused of sex crimes. There are a number of offenses that may qualify as sex crimes under California law, and these cases are not always as straightforward as one might think. The criminal justice system isn\u2019t perfect, and false accusations and wrongful convictions happen all too often, many times with devastating results. Ensuring that your side of the story is heard in a sex crime case is too important to leave to chance. You need immediate legal help if you hope to successfully challenge sex crime allegations and safeguard your freedom and your livelihood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-constitutes-a-sex-crime\">What Constitutes a Sex Crime?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex crimes are criminal offenses of a sexual nature. The term \u201csex crime\u201d does not describe any specific criminal act. Rather, it is an umbrella term used to define any illegal or forced sexual contact or conduct against another person. This term covers a wide range of criminal activity, from rape to exposing yourself to another person without their consent. The following are some examples of sex crimes in California:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lewd acts involving a minor<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Indecent exposure<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Child pornography<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevenslegal.com\/san-diego-rape-lawyer\/\"><u>Rape<\/u><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sodomy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevenslegal.com\/san-diego-prostitution-lawyer\/\"><u>Prostitution\/Solicitation<\/u><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevenslegal.com\/san-diego-assault-battery-lawyer\/\"><u>Sexual assault<\/u><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sexual battery<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Child molestation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sex trafficking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"penalties-for-sex-crimes\">Penalties for Sex Crimes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex crimes are taken extremely seriously in California. Prosecutors tend to be aggressive in their prosecution of sex crimes, and you could end up facing years in prison and a lifetime sex offender registration requirement if you are convicted of a felony sex crime, like rape. Under certain circumstances, a felony sex crime conviction may even be subject to California\u2019s \u201cOne Strike\u201d law (Penal Code 667.61 PC). This little-known law imposes harsh sentencing enhancements for offenders convicted of specific sex crimes with aggravating factors. If you are convicted of a qualifying crime and an aggravating factor is present, you could be sentenced to life in prison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"are-sex-crimes-felonies\">Are Sex Crimes Felonies?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under California law, criminal offenses are classified as either misdemeanors or felonies. This designation depends on several factors, including the nature and severity of the offense. Given the serious nature of sex crimes, the vast majority of these crimes are charged as felonies and are punishable by several years\u2019 imprisonment in state prison. Some less serious sex crimes are misdemeanors, and some are wobblers, meaning they can be filed as either misdemeanors or felonies, usually at the prosecutor\u2019s discretion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"sex-offender-registry-requirements\">Sex Offender Registry Requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are convicted of a sex crime in California, you will likely be required to register as a sex offender. The sex offender registry monitors and tracks convicted sex offenders after their return to society, and this information is made available to the public. Being a registered sex offender is something that can follow you for the rest of your life. For most misdemeanor sex crimes, (i.e. indecent exposure or sexual battery), you will not be required to register as a sex offender for life. However, most serious felony sex crimes (i.e. rape, sexual assault of a child, or sex trafficking) do call for lifetime registration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"will-sex-offender-laws-ever-change\">Will Sex Offender Laws Ever Change?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your name, personal information, and criminal record is listed on the sex offender registry, there is very little you can do to avoid the stigma of being publicly labeled a convicted sex offender. However, there are important changes being made in California to lessen the lasting impact of sex offender registration for less serious sex crime offenses. California recently introduced a new law that converted the state\u2019s lifetime sex offender registration system to a tier-based system. Under this new system, convicted offenders are required to register and remain on the list for 10 years, 20 years, or life, depending on the severity of the crime they are accused of committing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"schedule-a-free-consultation-with-sevens-legal\">Schedule a Free Consultation with Sevens Legal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sex crimes are serious allegations that should not be taken lightly, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is no hope for those accused of such crimes.
