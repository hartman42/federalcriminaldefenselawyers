This can include using false documentation or misrepresenting facts on immigration documents in an attempt to gain entry into the U.S., marrying someone strictly for immigration reasons, or providing fraudulent, unauthorized immigration services to individuals seeking to adjust their immigration status.<\/p>\n<p>Other common types of immigration fraud crimes that can be prosecuted by the federal government include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Using another person\u2019s identity to complete a visa application<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Fraudulently representing yourself as a qualified immigration attorney<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Fraudulent activity concerning the visa lottery<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Committing forgery or perjury<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Fraudulently representing yourself as qualified to offer legal advice to immigrants or immigration-related services<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Making a false statement about your immigration status in order to obtain employment<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Using a false identity on an immigration document<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Misrepresenting facts on an immigration form<\/p>\n<p>The federal government has made it a priority to investigate allegations of immigration fraud and if you are suspected of committing marriage fraud, immigration services fraud, or benefit or identity fraud in connection with the U.S. immigration system, you could end up being charged with a federal offense.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/immigration-fraud\/\"><b>Marriage Fraud<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Marriage fraud is one of the most common types of immigration fraud in the United States. Marriage fraud occurs when a person enters into a sham marriage for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit without the intention of creating a real marital relationship. Like any other fraud offense, the federal government takes marriage fraud extremely seriously and if you are suspected of committing marriage fraud, U.S. immigration officials have the authority to intrude upon your personal life and investigate.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your specific circumstances, you may be required to take part in an in-person interview and provide supporting documentation proving that your marriage is legitimate. In some cases, however, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency may conduct a background check and\/or interview your family, friends and employer. The authorities may even show up at your home at inconvenient hours to determine whether you and your spouse are, in fact, cohabitating.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Document Fraud<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Document fraud, also known as immigration benefit or identify fraud, is a federal offense involving any unlawful act in which a person or entity knowingly forges, counterfeits, sells or alters any document for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit, including identifying documentation (IDs).<\/p>\n<p>The crime known as document fraud also includes any use or attempted use of fraudulent immigration documents, as well as any unlawful activity that involves preparing, filing, or assisting another person in preparing or filing any fraudulent immigration document or application for benefits. Document or identity fraud is often used to evade U.S. immigration laws and such crimes are therefore a major target for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Immigration Services Fraud<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>In some cases, immigration fraud charges are brought against individuals or companies accused of providing fraudulent and unauthorized immigration services or those who use such services to illegally gain entry into the U.S. You could be at risk for immigration services fraud charges if you have been accused of charging another person money to assist that person with immigration forms or other immigration services and failing to provide qualified assistance, or if you have represented yourself as qualified to offer legal advice or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.superiorimmigrationlawyers.com\"> immigration services<\/a> to immigrants despite not having the necessary qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>Any time an individual or company fraudulently provides false information or misrepresents facts on behalf of someone else during the immigration process, both parties may be at risk for immigration fraud charges.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">How is Immigration Fraud Punished?<\/h2>\n<p>Like most federal fraud offenses, a conviction for immigration fraud carries harsh, life-changing criminal penalties. However, the exact punishment imposed by the court will vary depending on the specific immigration fraud charge you are facing and the purpose of the alleged fraudulent activity. For example, any person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546 by knowingly forging, counterfeiting, altering or falsely making any immigrant or non-immigrant visa or other document to secure entry into or employment within the U.S. faces the following maximum prison sentences:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 25 years, if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 20 years, if the offense was committed to facilitate a drug trafficking crime<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 10 years, in the case of the first or second offense, if the offense was not committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism or a drug trafficking crime<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 15 years, in case of any other offense<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you violate 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1325 by knowingly entering into a marriage for the purpose of evading any provision of U.S. immigration laws, you could face a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to five years or fines of up to $250,000, or both.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to a prison sentence and substantial fine, a conviction for immigration fraud in federal court will have other serious consequences and can even serve as grounds for deportation and a lifetime ban from the United States as outlined in 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1227. On top of that, individuals found guilty of immigration fraud can also be charged with other federal offenses, such as visa fraud, conspiracy and\/or making false statements, each carrying additional fines and prison sentences.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Defenses Against Immigration Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>In any federal immigration fraud case, the prosecution bears the burden of proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict the defendant, which leaves room for a skilled <a href=\"\/\">federal defense attorney<\/a> to present evidence and testimony that contradicts the production\u2019s case and raises reasonable doubt.
