Mortgage fraud crimes can be committed by homebuyers, appraisers, mortgage brokers, real estate attorneys or other real estate professionals for the purpose of securing housing or misusing the mortgage lending process to steal cash and equity from lenders or houseowners. In pursuing charges for mortgage fraud, the federal government recognizes two distinct types of criminal conduct:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Fraud for Profit <\/b>\u2013 Perpetrators of this offense often include industry insiders and professionals engaged in the industry, such as bank officers, appraisers, underwriters, attorneys and mortgage brokers who have an in-depth understanding of mortgages and use their authority or specialized knowledge to commit or facilitate the fraud.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Fraud for Housing<\/b> \u2013 Fraud for housing is the other main type of mortgage fraud. It usually involves borrowers obtaining a mortgage loan or real estate ownership using lies and deception, i.e. misrepresenting income and assets on a loan application or persuading an appraiser to manipulate the appraised value of a property.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Mortgage Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>Mortgage fraud is a broad legal term covering a wide range of unlawful conduct involving any situation where one party uses inaccurate or false information on mortgage documents to defraud another. Because mortgage fraud is not a standalone federal charge, any person accused of this crime may be charged under the federal statutes that prohibit wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy or other fraud-related crimes, depending on the circumstances of the case.<\/p>\n<p>The criminal conduct known collectively as mortgage fraud consists of any number of illegal schemes, each of which involves some type of intentional misstatement or misrepresentation on mortgage documents. The following are some of the most common types of mortgage fraud:<\/p>\n<p><b>Silent second<\/b> \u2013 A situation where a homebuyer takes out a second mortgage to cover the down payment on the first mortgage loan without informing the initial lender.<\/p>\n<p><b>Inflated appraisal<\/b> \u2013 An appraiser provides an over-inflated appraisal value that matches the amount the buyer is offering in order to complete the deal. Usually, this is done in collusion with the loan officer and\/or mortgage broker.<\/p>\n<p><b>Stolen identity<\/b> \u2013 A mortgage loan applicant uses someone else\u2019s identity on a mortgage loan application without the person\u2019s knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><b>Straw buyer<\/b> \u2013 A mortgage loan is obtained using the name and credit history of a straw buyer or nominee with the intention of concealing the borrower\u2019s identity.<\/p>\n<p><b>Equity skimming<\/b> \u2013 An investor uses a nominee as well as false income information and credit reports to obtain a mortgage loan in the name of the straw buyer (nominee). After the property is signed over to the investor, the straw buyer rents the property until it is foreclosed, without making payments on the mortgage loan.<\/p>\n<p><b>Fraudulent supporting loan documentation<\/b> \u2013 A mortgage loan applicant submits altered or forged paycheck stubs or other fraudulent supporting documentation.<\/p>\n<p><b>Property flipping<\/b> \u2013 A property is purchased, fraudulently appraised at an over-inflated value, and then quickly resold.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Potential Penalties for Mortgage Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>Mortgage fraud is prohibited under both California state law and federal law. Because mortgage fraud can involve a wide range of illegal acts, the potential penalties for mortgage fraud will vary depending on the specific facts of the case. The following are some of the statutes that the federal government can use to prosecute mortgage fraud, as well as their associated penalties:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371)<\/b> \u2013 up to five years in prison, plus a potential fine<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Making false statements on a loan or credit application (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1014) <\/b>\u2013 up to 30 years in prison or up to $1 million in fines, or both<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343)<\/b> \u2013 up to 30 years in prison or up to $1 million in fines, or both (if the fraud affects a financial institution); otherwise, up to 20 years in prison<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) <\/b>\u2013 up to 30 years in prison or up to $1 million in fines, or both (if the fraud affects a financial institution); otherwise, up to 20 years in prison<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Bank fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344)<\/b> \u2013 up to 30 years in prison or up to $1 million in fines, or both<\/p>\n<p>On top of a lengthy prison sentence and fines, the courts may also require the defendant to pay restitution payments, especially in cases where the lender has sustained monetary damages as a result of the fraud. In other instances, allegations of mortgage fraud may lead to additional charges such as bankruptcy fraud, tax fraud, or other types of criminal or fraudulent conduct, which can in turn increase the associated criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Possible Defenses for Mortgage Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>As stated above, federal mortgage fraud charges can be brought against anyone involved in a mortgage fraud scheme, including borrowers, bank officers, appraisers, mortgage brokers and other real estate professionals. Whether you are being charged as a homebuyer or an industry professional, the burden of proof in a mortgage fraud case lies with the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>In order to get a conviction on charges of mortgage fraud, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you deliberately engaged or attempted to engage in mortgage fraud. To mount a successful defense, your defense attorney will need to convince the judge or jury that:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You have been falsely accused of mortgage fraud,<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 The prosecutors have insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction,<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You provided true, correct and accurate information on your mortgage loan application, and\/or<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You were acting in good faith and did not intend to break the law.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Why You Need to Hire a Criminal Defense Attorney<\/h2>\n<p>Given the complex nature of mortgage fraud crimes and the severe repercussions associated with a fraud conviction, it is critical that you hire a knowledgeable criminal defense lawyer who can offer you skilled representation in your mortgage fraud case.<\/p>\n<p>In order to successfully defend you against any charges regarding mortgage fraud, the defense attorney you choose should have a clear understanding of federal law and extensive experience representing clients in federal court.
