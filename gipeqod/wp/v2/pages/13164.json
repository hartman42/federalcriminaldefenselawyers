Generally speaking, misappropriation involves the intentional and unlawful use of funds, assets or property for another use or for some unauthorized purpose other than its intended purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Both embezzlement and misappropriation are white-collar crimes that fall under the category of financial fraud. What sets these two offenses apart from other theft crimes is the fact that individuals accused of misappropriation and\/or embezzlement typically have an added degree of responsibility to care for and protect the money, property or assets they are accused of taking. For instance, the alleged offender in a federal misappropriation case may be a public official, a trustee or an executor of a deceased person\u2019s estate.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Types of Misappropriation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There are different categories of misappropriation that can result in criminal charges and these crimes are distinguished by the type of property the alleged offender is accused of misusing:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Misappropriation of Funds<\/b> \u2013 The most common type of misappropriation is misappropriation of funds, which is the unlawful use of another person\u2019s money without authorization. The crime of misappropriation of funds is typically committed by someone who was entrusted with the control, but not ownership, of another person, organization or entity\u2019s money.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Misappropriation of Assets<\/b> \u2013 Misappropriation of assets is similar to misappropriation of funds in that the offense is committed by a person with the responsibility to care for and protect assets belonging to an organization or entity, such as equipment or inventory.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Trade Secret Misappropriation<\/b> \u2013 Another type of misappropriation is trade secret misappropriation, which occurs when someone improperly and without consent acquires and\/or discloses a trade secret, i.e. intellectual property or confidential company information that is not generally known to the public, that has inherent economic value to the owner and that the owner takes reasonable measures to keep secret. Misappropriation of trade secrets is a form of unfair competition.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Misappropriation Charges and Penalties<\/h2>\n<p>While most misappropriation of funds cases are prosecuted in state court, there are certain circumstances under which allegations of misappropriation can be charged and tried in federal court. For instance, if the misappropriation case involves large sums of money, if the funds or property belonged to the federal government, or if the alleged criminal activity affects interstate commerce, the federal government may have jurisdiction over the case. The specific charge and penalties associated with federal misappropriation vary according to the circumstances of the alleged offense.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Misappropriation of Funds<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There are several federal statutes related to misappropriation that prohibit the misuse or theft of public funds or government property. For instance, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f641 prohibits individuals from embezzling, stealing or knowingly converting to their own use or the use of another, or without authorization, selling or disposing of, any money or property belonging to the federal government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 644 prohibits individuals who are not authorized depositaries of public funds from knowingly receiving such funds or using, transferring, converting, appropriating or applying such funds for any purpose not specified by law.<\/p>\n<p>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 648 forbids custodians of public funds from loaning, using, or converting those funds, or depositing or exchanging them without authorization. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 653 prohibits any other misuse of government funds by disbursing officers, including converting, loaning or depositing government funds without authorization, and unlawfully withdrawing, transferring or applying these funds. Finally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 forbids government employees from wrongfully converting the property of others which they receive in the course of their employment.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Trade Secret Misappropriation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Trade secret misappropriation is punishable under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1832 \u2013 theft of trade secrets, which carries a potential penalty of incarceration for up to 10 years. If the crime is committed by an organization, the organization can also be fined up to five million dollars, or three times the value of the stolen trade secret, plus expenses for research and design and other costs associated with reproducing the trade secret, whichever amount is greater. In cases where a trade secret has been misappropriated and the trade secret in question is \u201crelated to a product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate or foreign commerce,\u201d the owner of the trade secret may also be able to bring a civil action under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1836.<\/p>\n<p>According to the federal trade secret misappropriation statute, federal criminal charges can be brought against any person who \u201cwith intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to a product or service used in or intended for use in interstate or foreign commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will, injure any owner of that trade secret,\u201d knowingly commits any of the following acts:<\/p>\n<p>(1) steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes or conceals, or by fraud, artifice, or deception obtains such information;<\/p>\n<p>(2) without authorization copies, duplicates, photographs, downloads, uploads, alters, destroys, photocopies, replicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails, communicates, or conveys such information;<\/p>\n<p>(3) receives, buys, or possesses such information, knowing that it has been stolen or appropriated, obtained, or converted without authorization;<\/p>\n<p>(4) attempts to commit any offense described in paragraphs (1) through (3); or<\/p>\n<p>(5) conspires with one or more other persons to commit any offense described in paragraphs (1) through (3), and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Misappropriation Defense Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you have been accused of committing a misappropriation offense does not mean you are guilty of the crime. In order for a jury to find you guilty of misappropriation, the prosecution much prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. For instance, if the charge is misappropriation of funds, the prosecution must show the following:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Control but not ownership:<\/b> The defendant was entrusted with the possession or control of funds belonging to another person, organization or entity, but did not have ownership of the funds,<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Intent: <\/b>The defendant knowingly misappropriated the money or took an action that resulted in the misappropriation of funds, and<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Conversion: <\/b>The defendant not only took the money, but also used the money for his own purposes (This can include using the money to purchase something, transferring the money to another bank account, or simply refusing to hand over the money to the rightful owner when the person demands it).<\/p>\n<p>Even if you misappropriate funds with the intention of returning the money to the rightful owner at a later date, you can still be found guilty of federal misappropriation, even if the money was only taken for a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>You have a right to defend against misappropriation charges or any other criminal charge brought against you by the federal government, and there are a number of effective legal defenses a skilled <a href=\"\/\">federal attorney<\/a> can present in a misappropriation case.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you have been accused of misappropriating funds and the alleged misappropriation was actually a mistake or a clerical error, your attorney may argue that you did not intend to misappropriate the funds. Or, your attorney may provide evidence that you reasonably believed that you had ownership over the funds or that you were given consent by the owner to remove and use the funds.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Contact the Misappropriation Defense Attorneys at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers<\/h2>\n<p>Being charged with a federal crime like misappropriation is not something that should be taken lightly.
