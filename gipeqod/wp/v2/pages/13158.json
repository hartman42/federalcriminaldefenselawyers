Most minor offenses involving possession of small quantities of drugs in California are handled by local law enforcement and tried in the state court system.<\/p>\n<p>However, certain serious drug-related activities can trigger federal charges, as can large quantities of drugs or money, or the involvement of multiple people. For instance, if you are accused of manufacturing or trafficking drugs as part of a drug operation, you will most likely be charged with a federal crime. Often, such drug charges are accompanied by additional allegations involving <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/money-laundering\/\">money laundering<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-conspiracy-charges\/\">drug conspiracy<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/rico-cases\/\">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Allegations of drug distribution can also lead to federal charges if you are arrested by federal agents, or if the alleged criminal activity took place on federal property (i.e. a military base or national park) or crossed state lines or international borders. For instance, if you traveled from California into another state to buy, sell, obtain or deliver an illicit drug or controlled substance, you could face federal drug distribution charges. The federal statute that covers drug distribution offenses is 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 841, which makes it a crime to knowingly or intentionally:<\/p>\n<p>1. Manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with the intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, a controlled substance; or<\/p>\n<p>2. Create, distribute, or dispense, or possess with the intent to distribute or dispense a counterfeit substance.<\/p>\n<p>Pursuant to this law, even being caught in possession of a large quantity of drugs, whether or not you actually intended to sell the drugs, could put you at risk for federal drug distribution charges. Smuggling drugs into the United States from another country is also a federal offense, and if you are accused of importing or smuggling cocaine or another controlled substance into the U.S. from outside the country, you could be charged with unlawful drug importation or drug smuggling in federal court.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Drugs and Substances Regulated by the Federal Government<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The federal government regulates the use, possession, manufacture, sale and distribution of illegal drugs, prescription drugs, substances and certain chemicals used to make drugs that pose a potential risk of abuse or addiction. These are known as controlled substances and the substances are assigned to one of five distinct categories, or schedules, based on their accepted medical use and abuse or dependency potential.<\/p>\n<p>Drugs in Schedule I have a high potential for abuse and dependence and no currently accepted medical use (this includes marijuana, which is illegal under federal law), while drugs in Schedule V have the lowest potential for abuse. The following are some examples of drugs found in each schedule, although it is important to note that a substance need not be listed as a controlled substance to be treated as such for the purposes of criminal prosecution, according to the DEA:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule I: <\/b>Marijuana, heroin, LSD<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule II: <\/b>Cocaine, methamphetamine, oxycodone<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule III: <\/b>Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule IV:<\/b> Xanax, Ambien, Darvocet<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule V: <\/b>Robitussin AC, Lyrica, Lomotil<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Penalties for Drug Distribution<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most important things to understand about serious federal drug charges like drug distribution is that these kinds of offenses carry mandatory minimum prison sentences. Under California state law, first-time drug offenders have several opportunities to avoid jail time, but the federal statute that covers drug distribution offenses includes a specific minimum term of imprisonment, which means a conviction almost always results in incarceration.<\/p>\n<p>The specific penalties associated with a federal drug distribution conviction vary considerably based on the facts of the case, namely the type and amount of the illicit drug or controlled substance involved in the offense.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this as an example: If you are convicted on charges of distributing or possessing with the intent to distribute five grams of methamphetamine, 100 grams of heroin or 100 kilograms of marijuana, the minimum sentence that will be handed down by the court upon conviction is five years and the maximum sentence is 40 years. And the higher the quantity of the controlled substance involved in the drug distribution offense, the more severe the penalty. For example, if the alleged criminal activity involves 50 grams of methamphetamine, one kilogram of heroin or 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, the minimum sentence will instead be 10 years and the maximum sentence will be life in prison. The fines associated with drug distribution offenses are also substantial.<\/p>\n<p>For Schedule V drugs, the fines resulting from a conviction can range from $100,000 to $250,000. For Schedule I to Schedule IV drugs, the fines can range from $1 million to $50 million.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, the court may impose more severe penalties on federal defendants in drug distribution cases depending on the existence of certain specified circumstances. For instance, if you are convicted on charges of distributing drugs to someone who is pregnant or under the age of 21, if the alleged drug distribution offense occurs on or near a school zone, or if you have a prior conviction for a serious drug felony or serious violent felony, you could face additional penalties upon conviction.<\/p>\n<p>For a drug distribution offense carrying a minimum penalty of five years to 40 years that occurs after a prior conviction for a serious drug-related or violent felony, the sentence would be increased to 10 years to life. A minimum penalty of 10 years would become 20 years to life in this case.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Why You Need a Criminal Defense Lawyer<\/h2>\n<p>If you are facing federal charges for drug distribution, your entire future is at risk.
