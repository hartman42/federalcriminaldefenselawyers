Weapons violations are commonly charged against individuals involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-drug-cases\/\">federal drug cases<\/a>, most notably those involving crimes like <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-trafficking\/\">drug trafficking<\/a>, or the unlawful transportation of illegal drugs or controlled substances.<\/p>\n<p>Federal authorities have made it a priority to crack down on serious drug crimes and they have a great deal of leeway to investigate and prosecute drug-related offenses like drug trafficking. In fact, if any firearm is present at the time a drug trafficking crime takes place, the government may claim that the firearm was used to aid in the illegal <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-distribution\/\">distribution of drugs<\/a>, which can result in federal weapons charges.<\/p>\n<p>Federal law also prohibits many other types of individuals in California from possessing or carrying firearms, including those with prior convictions for felony offenses, and any person found guilty of violating such laws can face federal charges for a weapons-related offense. Our <a href=\"\/\">federal lawyers<\/a> have a great deal of experience defending clients against a variety of weapons charges, including the following:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Unlawful possession of a firearm<\/b> \u2013 Possessing a firearm without the proper license or illegally possessing a firearm as a felon<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Unlawful import and export of weapons<\/b> \u2013 Illegally importing weapons into the U.S. or exporting weapons from the U.S. into another country<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Firearms trafficking <\/b>\u2013 Illegally distributing weapons or ammunition<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/violent-crimes\/\"><b>Violent crimes involving the use of a firearm<\/b><\/a> \u2013 Any federal crime involving the unlawful use of a firearm will be considered a violent crime<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Fraud<\/b> \u2013 As a weapons charge, fraud refers to the crime of illegally obtaining a weapons permit<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Penalties for Federal Weapons Charges<\/h2>\n<p>If you have been accused of a federal weapons offense like unlawful possession, unlawful import\/export, firearms trafficking, fraud, or use of a firearm to commit a drug trafficking crime or federal violent crime, you could face serious criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances of the alleged crime, your criminal record and other specified factors, a conviction on federal weapons charges could result in significant fines, prison time and other life-changing legal consequences.

The consequences of a federal weapons offense are most severe in cases where someone is seriously injured or killed.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Defense Against Weapons Charges<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see, federal weapons charges are extremely serious, potentially life-changing criminal charges, and if you want to maximize your chances of success, you should get a knowledgeable defense lawyer involved as early on in your case as possible.<\/p>\n<p>An experienced attorney understands the myriad issues that can occur in a federal weapons offense case and is prepared to deal with these potential issues as they arise.
