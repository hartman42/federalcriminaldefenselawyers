Each state, California included, has its own set of laws (the California Penal Code) that state residents must abide by and the federal government also has its own set of laws (the United States Code) that apply to residents of every state.<\/p>\n<p>If you are accused of committing a state crime, you will likely be arrested by state or local law enforcement officers and be prosecuted in a state court in California. If you are convicted of the crime, the punishment you face will be determined by state law and may include a county jail or state prison sentence.<\/p>\n<p>If you are accused of committing a federal crime, however, you will likely be arrested by federal agents from the FBI, DEA or some other federal agency and be prosecuted by a federal prosecutor, also known as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Your case will take place in a federal district court and the penalties handed down by the court will be dictated by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. As such, the punishment for a federal offense is almost always more severe than the punishment for the same or similar charge at the state level, and if you are convicted and sentenced to prison for a federal crime, you will serve your sentence in a federal prison.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the nature of the alleged criminal activity, a criminal case may begin in federal court, or what starts out as a state case may be moved to federal court for one reason or another. In some cases, it may even be possible for a defendant to be prosecuted in both a California state court and a federal court for a single crime that violates both the California Penal Code and the United States Code.<\/p>\n<p>Any time you are facing charges for a federal crime, whether the charge is for fraud, money laundering, a drug-related offense, a violent crime or some other crime, it is in your best interest to consult a federal criminal defense attorney who understands both state and federal law and can advise you on the best course of action based on your specific situation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/federal-charges\/\">What to do First<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/hire-federal-lawyer\/\">Hire a Federal Attorney<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/federal-investigations\/\">Involved in a Federal Investigation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/arrested-by-federal-agents\/\">Arrested by a Federal Agent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/federal-agents-home-visit\/\">Search Warrant<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/federal-defense\/receive-target-letter\/&quot;\">Received a Target Letter<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Cases Our Lawyers Handle<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to defending yourself against federal criminal charges, choosing a reputable defense attorney who has an in-depth understanding of federal law can make a significant difference in the outcome of your case.

Consider the following:<\/p>\n<p>If you are found guilty of making a false statement in any matter that falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government, a violation of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1001, you could be fined and sentenced to a maximum of five years in federal prison, or a maximum of eight years, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism. Marriage fraud, a type of immigration fraud that violates 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1325(c), carries a similar punishment upon conviction \u2013 a fine of up to $250,000 and\/or a prison sentence of up to five years.<\/p>\n<p>However, more serious federal crimes carry far more devastating penalties, some with mandatory minimum sentences. Mandatory minimums were enacted by Congress to establish prison terms of a particular length for individuals convicted of certain federal crimes. Unfortunately, mandatory minimum sentences prevent judges in federal cases from taking into account each defendant\u2019s unique background and the circumstances of his offense when determining the appropriate sentence, which is what ensures a fair and just sentence. At the federal level, most mandatory minimum sentences apply to drug-related offenses.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the federal crime of drug trafficking (21 U.S. Code \u00a7 841) is punishable by a term of between five and 40 years for offenses involving specific quantities of controlled substances or between 10 years and life imprisonment for larger quantities. There are other federal offenses that also carry mandatory minimum sentences, including certain weapons offenses.<\/p>\n<p>Drug crimes are punished harshly in the United States, but there are other federal crimes that carry significantly more severe penalties. For instance, a charge of second-degree murder at the federal level (a violation of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1111) is punishable by any term of years or by imprisonment for life, and a charge of first-degree murder is punishable by death or by imprisonment for life.<\/p>\n<p>These lengthy prison sentences are all the more devastating considering the fact that there is no parole in the federal justice system, which means convicted offenders will generally serve the full sentence imposed by the court, unless they get time off for good behavior (maximum 15% of the prison sentence) or qualify for a period of supervised release at the end of their sentence.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Defending Yourself Against Federal Charges<\/h2>\n<p>Federal criminal charges can be brought against any person accused of committing a crime that violates the federal criminal code or one that involves a federal agency or government department (i.e. the post office or any FDIC-insured bank), takes place on federal property (i.e. a national park or military base), crosses state lines or international borders, or is committed using the internet, among other unlawful acts.<\/p>\n<p>If you are facing charges for a federal crime in California, our seasoned federal crimes defense attorneys at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers can help you.
