Individuals who violate the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act by importing or exporting controlled substances without authorization, either for personal use or for commercial sale, can face serious criminal charges at the federal level.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Drug Importation \u2013 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 952<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The unlawful importation of controlled substances into the United States from another country is a violation of 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 952. Federal drug importation charges cover a wide variety of criminal offenses that range in severity from a person illegally importing a small amount of a prescription medication for their own personal use to a person involved in a criminal enterprise importing large quantities of narcotics or unapproved prescription drugs intended for commercial sale. If you are accused of the latter, you could also <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-trafficking\/\">face charges for drug trafficking<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-distribution\/\">drug distribution<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-smuggling\/\">drug smuggling<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Drug Exportation \u2013 21 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f953<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The unlawful exportation of controlled substances from the United States to another country is also a crime, a violation of 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 953. This law covers any illegal activity in which illicit drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs are transported across the boundaries of the U.S. into another country without permission.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Drug Schedules<\/h2>\n<p>The Federal government has classified a number of illegal drugs, substances and certain chemicals used to make drugs into five separate categories, called schedules, based on their accepted medical use and abuse or dependency potential. The following are some examples of drugs in each of the five schedules. (It is important to note that these lists are not inclusive of all controlled substances):<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule I <\/b>\u2013 Heroin, marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, peyote<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule II <\/b>\u2013 Cocaine, methamphetamine, Vicodin, oxycodone, fentanyl, Adderall<\/p>\n<p>\u2022<b> Schedule III<\/b> \u2013 Testosterone, anabolic steroids, ketamine, Tylenol with codeine<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule IV<\/b> \u2013 Xanax, Ambien, Tramadol, Valium<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Schedule V<\/b> \u2013 Lyrica, Lomotil, Robitussin AC<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Penalties for Drug Importation\/Exportation<\/h2>\n<p>The penalties handed down by the court in federal drug importation\/exportation cases are dictated by the mandatory minimum sentences assigned to drug-related crimes under federal law and are based on the type and quantity of the drugs involved. For example, the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime involving the unlawful importation of 500 grams or more of cocaine, 100 grams or more of heroin, or 100 kilograms or more of marijuana is five years in prison (and up to 40 years).<\/p>\n<p>For a drug importation crime involving the unlawful importation of five kilograms or more of cocaine, one kilogram or more of heroin, or 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, the mandatory minimum sentence is 10 years in prison (and up to life in prison). Pursuant to 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 960, any person who knowingly or intentionally:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1. Imports or exports a listed chemical for the purpose of manufacturing a controlled substance in violation of federal law,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2. Exports a listed chemical in violation of the laws of the country to which the chemical is exported, or<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">3. Imports or exports a listed chemical knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the chemical will be used for the unlawful manufacturing of a controlled substance,<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">faces a term of imprisonment not to exceed 20 years (for a violation of (1) or (3) involving a list I chemical) or not to exceed 10 years for any other violation involving a list I chemical, plus a fine.<\/p>\n<p>Drug importation\/exportation charges are often connected to other federal drug-related charges like drug trafficking, drug distribution, drug conspiracy, drug smuggling and <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/money-laundering\/\">money laundering<\/a>, which carry their own potential prison sentences and fines.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Why Hiring a Criminal Defense Attorney is Essential<\/h2>\n<p>Facing criminal charges for drug importation or exportation is not something that should be taken lightly. While other drug crimes, like drug trafficking and drug distribution, can be charged as either a state crime or federal crime depending on the circumstances of the criminal act, drug importation and drug exportation offenses are always charged at the federal level, since only the federal government has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals accused of transporting drugs across the boundaries of the United States, whether they are entering or exiting the country.<\/p>\n<p>At Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers, we know that drug importation\/exportation charges have the potential to cause serious problems for you and your loved ones and we are committed to protecting your rights and freedoms as thoroughly and efficiently as possible.
