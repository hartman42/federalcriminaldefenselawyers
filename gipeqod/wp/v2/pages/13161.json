White-collar crimes like money laundering and mortgage fraud are characterized by deceit, concealment or some violation of trust, and while these charges can be brought against virtually anyone, white-collar cases typically involve professionals or government employees with access to money, assets or sensitive data belonging to someone else. The following are some examples of federal offenses that fall under the umbrella of federal white-collar crime.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/false-statements\/\"><b>False Statements<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cMaking false statements\u201d is the name given to the federal law that prohibits knowingly and willfully making false or fraudulent statements, or concealing information, in \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction\u201d of the federal government. Making false statements is known as a federal process crime, or an offense against the judicial process. False statement charges typically arise in cases where a materially false statement is made to a federal agent in connection with a federal matter (i.e. lying during an FBI interview or misrepresenting income to the IRS).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/white-collar-crimes\/\"><b>Internet Crimes<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>The term internet crime is used in a broad sense to describe any criminal offense committed through the use of the internet or any crime in which a person uses a computer to gain access to data in a system without permission to access that data, otherwise known as hacking. Internet crime offenses can include everything from identity theft, computer fraud, internet extortion and investment fraud to sex crimes like distribution of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children, depending on the circumstances of the case.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Embezzlement<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Embezzlement is a type of white-collar crime that occurs any time a person entrusted with the care or control of another person\u2019s money or assets takes or uses the money or assets for his own personal gain. Embezzlement at the state level usually occurs in a business setting, when an employee in a position of trust steals from his employer or company. However, embezzlement can be charged as a federal crime if the money or property that was embezzled belongs to the federal government or any agency of the United States, or if the person accused of committing embezzlement is a government employee or an officer or employee of an FDIC-insured bank.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/misappropriation\/\"><b>Misappropriation<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Embezzlement is closely connected to the crime of misappropriation, which occurs when a person knowingly and intentionally misuses funds, assets or personal property belonging to another person. Depending on the specific facts of the case, a person can face charges in federal court for misappropriating, funds, assets or trade secrets.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/money-laundering\/\"><b>Money Laundering<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most high-profile white-collar crimes prosecuted at the federal level in the United States is money laundering. The term money laundering describes the process of taking \u201cdirty\u201d money derived from criminal activity and passing it through a series of commercial transactions or banking transfers in order to disguise its source. The purpose of money laundering is to make the criminally derived proceeds appear \u201cclean,\u201d as though they came from a legitimate source, thereby allowing individuals to hide and accumulate wealth, evade taxes and fund further criminal activity. Often, money laundering is charged in combination with other financially motivated crimes, like mail fraud, wire fraud or racketeering (RICO).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/bankruptcy-fraud\/\"><b>Bankruptcy Fraud<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Another common type of white-collar fraud prosecuted at the federal level is bankruptcy fraud, or any attempt to defraud the bankruptcy system using lies, misrepresentations or deception. Bankruptcy fraud charges can be filed against any person who conceals assets in order to avoid having to forfeit them during the bankruptcy process, intentionally files false or incomplete bankruptcy forms, files bankruptcy multiple times in different jurisdictions, or bribes a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, among other unlawful bankruptcy-related activities.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/mortgage-fraud\/\"><b>Mortgage Fraud<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage fraud is a federal offense characterized by some type of material misrepresentation, misstatement or omission in relation to a mortgage loan. This type of crime can take on many different forms. For instance, a borrower who misrepresents or falsifies income and assets on a loan application in order to fraudulently obtain a mortgage can be charged with federal mortgage fraud, as can any appraiser who deliberately undervalues a property to ensure that a fellow investor is able to purchase the asset.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Prosecution of White-Collar Crime<\/h2>\n<p>The federal government views white-collar crimes as a threat to the economy and therefore prioritizes the detection, investigation and prosecution of financially motivated offenses like money laundering, misappropriation, bankruptcy fraud and embezzlement. These types of crimes also carry harsh penalties upon conviction \u2013 for bankruptcy fraud, you could be imprisoned in federal prison for up to five years, and for money laundering, you could be imprisoned for up to 20 years. Unfortunately, there is no parole in the federal system, which means convicted offenders have fewer opportunities for early release.<\/p>\n<p>Given the government\u2019s strict approach to white-collar crime and the life-altering penalties you could face upon conviction, we always advise white-collar suspects to avoid speaking to federal agents without an attorney present, even if they are innocent of the crime in question. If you choose to cooperate with a federal investigation without first consulting a white-collar crimes attorney, you could end up inadvertently admitting guilt or implicating yourself in a criminal matter, which is exactly what the investigators are hoping you will do. When you retain the services of a knowledgeable criminal defense attorney, your attorney will ensure that your rights are protected at every stage and prevent you from making grievous mistakes that can damage your case.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Defending Against White-Collar Crime Charges<\/h2>\n<p>White-collar crimes may seem less serious than violent crimes, sex crimes and drug offenses \u2013 after all, they are accomplished through nonviolent means \u2013 but the fact is that federal authorities take white-collar crime extremely seriously and prosecutors typically seek significant prison time for defendants in white-collar cases.<\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself facing criminal charges for a white-collar crime like fraud, money laundering or false statements, you need a defense attorney on your side who will fight aggressively to defend your rights and best interests.
