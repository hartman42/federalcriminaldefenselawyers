Filing for bankruptcy can be a complicated process and it is not unusual for filers to miscalculate or misstate assets, either intentionally or unintentionally, which may result in a charge of bankruptcy fraud.<\/p>\n<p>Bankruptcy fraud is a <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/other-white-collar-crimes\/\">white-collar crime<\/a> occurring any time a person commits a dishonest act in connection with a bankruptcy filing. This can include a debtor concealing assets to avoid being forced to forfeit the assets, filing false or incomplete bankruptcy forms, filing for bankruptcy multiple times in several jurisdictions, or even bribing a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee.<\/p>\n<p>The most common form of bankruptcy fraud occurs when a debtor conceals or attempts to conceal or undervalue assets so the bankruptcy trustee can\u2019t or won\u2019t seize them. The second most common form of bankruptcy fraud occurs when a debtor misrepresents income or expenses in order to fraudulently qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy or to reduce his Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments. There are other ways for debtors to commit bankruptcy fraud and it is also possible for creditors, bankruptcy trustees, court officials and others to be charged with federal bankruptcy fraud.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>18 U.S. Code \u00a7 157 \u2013 Bankruptcy Fraud<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The primary federal statute covering bankruptcy fraud offenses is 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 157, which states that any person who, \u201chaving devised or intending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and for the purpose of executing or concealing such a scheme or artifice or attempting to do so \u2014 (1) files a petition under title 11, including a fraudulent involuntary petition under section 303 of such title; (2) files a document in a proceeding under title 11; or (3) makes a false or fraudulent representation, claim, or promise concerning or in relation to a proceeding under title 11, at any time before or after the filing of the petition, or in relation to a proceeding falsely asserted to be pending under such title,\u201d is guilty of bankruptcy fraud.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>18 U.S. Code \u00a7 152 \u2013 Concealment of Assets, False Oaths and Claims, Bribery<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Bankruptcy fraud can also be prosecuted under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 152, the federal statute that prohibits certain behavior prior to and during a bankruptcy proceeding, including knowingly and fraudulently concealing assets, withholding information from the bankruptcy trustee, or <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/false-statements\/\">making false statements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Penalties for Bankruptcy Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>All fraud offenses are taken very seriously by the federal government and that includes bankruptcy fraud. As such, a violation of 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 157 or \u00a7 152 can lead to serious, potentially life-altering consequences, possibly including incarceration in federal prison, substantial fines and other penalties.<\/p>\n<p>If you are found guilty of bankruptcy fraud in violation of federal law, you can face a fine of up to $250,000 and\/or a prison sentence not to exceed five years. Even just attempting to commit bankruptcy fraud may be punishable under federal law, even if you don\u2019t actually commit the fraud. If the bankruptcy fraud charges against you are tied to other criminal offenses, such as mortgage fraud, identity theft or money laundering, you could face additional criminal charges and penalties if you are convicted of these other crimes.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to note that Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code provides an exception from the discharge of any debt for money, property services, or an extension, renewal or refinancing of credit that is obtained by false representation, false pretenses or actual fraud.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Defending Against Bankruptcy Fraud Charges<\/h2>\n<p>Being charged with any federal crime can be a frightening and stressful experience but facing charges for a fraud offense is a particularly serious matter, one that comes with devastating penalties.

However, while federal prosecutors can file criminal charges against any person suspected of committing bankruptcy fraud \u2013 debtors, creditors, bankruptcy trustees, etc. \u2013 they cannot secure a conviction without proving that the defendant knowingly and fraudulently misrepresented a material fact.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the circumstances of your bankruptcy fraud case, you will need a knowledgeable criminal defense lawyer on your side who can present an alternative explanation for the prosecution\u2019s evidence and show the judge and jury that you are innocent of the crime, and that is where our <a href=\"\/\">federal criminal defense attorneys<\/a> at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers come in.
