The FBI is the principal federal agency that investigates white-collar crimes like money laundering, embezzlement and fraud in the United States, and the agency has devoted a great deal of manpower and resources to bringing down individuals suspected of committing white-collar crimes.<\/p>\n<p>According to the FBI, white-collar crime costs the U.S. an estimated $300 billion annually, which is more than enough incentive for the government to aggressively pursue suspected <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/white-collar-crimes\/\">white-collar criminals<\/a>. If you or someone you love is facing white-collar crime charges at the federal level, do not hesitate to obtain skilled legal representation. Our defense attorneys at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers have a great deal of experience representing clients in white-collar crime cases and we can help you defend yourself against all types of <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/\">federal charges<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">What is White-Collar Crime?<\/h2>\n<p>The term \u201cwhite-collar crime\u201d is used to refer to a wide range of nonviolent, financially motivated crimes committed by business or government professionals for the purpose of securing a personal or business advantage or to obtain or avoid losing money or property. What makes white-collar crimes different from other theft crimes is the fact that they are not dependent on the use or threatened use of physical violence or force.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, these crimes are carried out through the use of deceit, concealment or a violation of trust, and the sophisticated nature of these federal offenses makes them particularly difficult for federal law enforcement agencies to detect. Often, the federal government will investigate white-collar crime allegations for months or even years before making an arrest, during which time they will subpoena documents, review bank records, conduct interviews and gather any other evidence related to the alleged criminal activity. They may even get approval from a federal judge to use wiretaps to help them build their case.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this unique approach to white-collar cases, if you are arrested for allegedly committing a white-collar crime or if you receive a target letter from the Department of Justice or the Assistant U.S. Attorney indicating that you are the target of a federal investigation, it is likely that the government has already compiled a great deal of evidence against you. That is why we always recommend consulting a seasoned federal criminal defense lawyer as soon as possible after learning that you are suspected of committing a white-collar crime.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Examples of Federal White-Collar Crimes<\/h2>\n<p>You have probably heard about some of the more well-known white-collar crimes like <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/embezzlement\/\">embezzlement<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/money-laundering\/\">money laundering<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/bankruptcy-fraud\/\">bankruptcy fraud<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/mortgage-fraud\/\">mortgage fraud<\/a> in the news. These white-collar crimes may be the most widely recognized, but they aren\u2019t the only white-collar crimes that can result in federal charges. There are a number of other criminal acts that can lead to federal white-collar crime charges in the United States, including the following:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Mail fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Wire fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Bank fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Identity theft<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Insider trading<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Healthcare fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Antitrust violations<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Income tax fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Ponzi schemes<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Counterfeiting<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Fraud against the government<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Forgery<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Securities and commodities fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Insurance fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Corporate fraud<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Extortion<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Credit card fraud<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>State vs. Federal Offenses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>While many white-collar crimes in California result in criminal charges being filed at the state level, crimes that target a government agency or department are generally charged as federal offenses, as are those that take place on federal property or cross state lines or international borders. In fact, the FBI focuses the bulk of its investigative efforts on sophisticated white-collar crime investigations, with an emphasis on federal offenses that have a potential connection to organized crime.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the complex nature of white-collar crimes in general, individuals charged with a crime like <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/money-laundering\/\">money laundering<\/a> or corporate fraud often end up facing multiple criminal charges. In this case, each alleged offense is charged as a separate crime carrying its own penalties.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Potential Penalties for Federal<\/h2>\n<p>Because the very nature of white-collar crime means such offenses almost always cross state lines, prosecution and sentencing for white-collar criminal offenses in the U.S. typically occurs at the federal level. In some cases, a white-collar crime can start out as a state offense and then be moved to federal court after the full scope of the alleged criminal activity is discovered.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, federal crimes carry far more severe penalties upon conviction than state crimes, although the severity of the punishment handed down by the court will depend a great deal on the nature of the alleged crime and the existence of any aggravating factors.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you are found guilty of healthcare fraud, a federal crime characterized by the knowing and willful execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice designed to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or fraudulently obtain money or property belonging to a federal healthcare benefit program, you could be fined and sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1347. If the alleged violation results in serious bodily injury, the punishment increases to a maximum of 20 years in prison, and if the alleged violation results in death, the punishment increases to a maximum term of life imprisonment.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are found guilty of bank fraud, a federal crime characterized by the knowing execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice designed to defraud a financial institution or fraudulently obtain money, assets, securities or other property belonging to a financial institution, you could be fined as much as $1,000,000 dollars and imprisoned for up to 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>What makes sentencing in federal cases even more complex is the fact that the specific prison term handed down by the court is dictated by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The guidelines are a set of rules that establish a uniform sentencing range that federal judges are required to consult when sentencing individuals convicted of criminal offenses in the federal court system.<\/p>\n<p>The sentencing ranges set forth by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines are meant to ensure equal punishment for similarly situated defendants. Instead, judges complain that the guidelines are too complex, severe and inflexible.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">White-Collar Crime Defense<\/h2>\n<p>The consequences of white-collar criminal activity can be devastating for affected individuals, businesses and government agencies, and the FBI is committed to aggressively investigating white-collar crime allegations in the United States.
