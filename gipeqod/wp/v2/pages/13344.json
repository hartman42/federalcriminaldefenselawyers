The most egregious federal offenses carry a sentence of life imprisonment or possibly even the death penalty. Unfortunately, because there is no parole in the federal criminal justice system, federal defendants often end up serving the full term of imprisonment, possibly with some time off for good behavior.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">How Our Federal Defense Attorneys Can Help You<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>We Can Protect Your Rights<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Facing charges for a federal crime is a very serious matter, one that demands the expertise of a criminal defense attorney with extensive experience representing clients in federal criminal cases. As a criminal defendant, you have certain rights afforded by the U.S. Constitution, and the only way to ensure that your legal rights are protected when facing charges for a federal crime is to hire a knowledgeable criminal defense lawyer to represent your case.<\/p>\n<p>If you have been arrested or charged with a federal criminal offense, the federal criminal defense lawyers at Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers will work tirelessly to protect your rights, your freedom and your future.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>We Can Negotiate with the Federal Prosecutor<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>In some federal cases, a plea bargain is the best way for a criminal defendant to obtain the lowest possible sentence. A plea bargain is a legal agreement between a prosecutor and a defendant in which the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a crime in return for a reduced sentence or a lesser charge. For instance, if you are facing criminal charges for murder, the prosecutor may offer to drop the murder count if you plead guilty to manslaughter.<\/p>\n<p>Often, prosecutors are willing to enter into a plea agreement so they can avoid a lengthy and costly criminal trial, and while this may seem like the best possible scenario, keep in mind that agreeing to a plea bargain is not a get out of jail free card. You may still have to pay fines and serve time in prison and you would also have a criminal record. In some cases, a plea bargain may require the defendant to agree to testify in another criminal case, which carries its own risks.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance, \u201cThe overwhelming majority (90 to 95 percent) of cases result in plea bargaining.\u201d If your attorney determines that accepting a plea bargain is in your best interest, he can negotiate with the federal prosecutor to get the most favorable terms based on your specific situation.<\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself in this position, having a seasoned federal defense attorney in your corner who has experience negotiating with federal prosecutors is crucial if you want to minimize your exposure to harsh criminal penalties and ensure that your legal rights are protected. As you can see, there are pros and cons to federal plea bargains, so you will want to consider every possible angle before agreeing to plead guilty to a federal crime.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>We Can Represent You in Federal Court<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>A plea agreement may sound like the best way to resolve your case, but it isn\u2019t always the way to go. Consider this, for example: although there are other reasons for a plea agreement, it is common for prosecutors to offer up a plea deal in federal cases when they feel that they don\u2019t have enough evidence to prove more serious charges in court, and by agreeing to a plea bargain, you could be accepting a conviction that the prosecutor may not have otherwise been able to acquire on the merit of his own case.<\/p>\n<p>By going to trial, you can buy more time to prepare your defense and strengthen your case. You also receive the full benefit of your constitutional rights, including the right to have a trial by jury and the presumption of innocence. In any criminal case, the prosecution is required to prove each element of the criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a very high standard of proof.<\/p>\n<p>For some criminal defendants in the federal system, going to trial and arguing their case before a judge and jury is the most suitable path to justice. However, going to trial also presents certain risks. For one, if your case goes to trial, you could be found guilty of the crime and face harsh penalties, possibly including a lengthy federal prison sentence. And if the crime you are found guilty of carries a mandatory minimum sentence, the consequences of a conviction may be even more severe.<\/p>\n<p>At Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers, our criminal defense lawyers believe in protecting our clients\u2019 constitutional rights and giving them their best possible shot at avoiding severe criminal penalties that could ruin their reputation and tear them from their loved ones, and sometimes that means going to trial. When you hire our firm, we will prepare your case for trial from the very beginning to ensure that we are prepared for the possibility of fighting the charges in court.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">When to Consult a Federal Criminal Defense Lawyer<\/h2>\n<p>Any experience with the federal criminal justice system is scary, and if you are under investigation for a federal crime, even if you have yet to be formally charged, you may be wondering whether you need to hire an attorney.
