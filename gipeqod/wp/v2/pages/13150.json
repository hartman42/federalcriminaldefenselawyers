If you are under investigation for a serious federal offense like embezzlement, drug distribution, money laundering or RICO violations, you are up against the federal government and the stakes are higher than ever. That means you don\u2019t need just any attorney, you need an attorney who is an expert in his field, one who has a clear understanding of the federal court process and the United States Code.<\/p>\n<p>The consequences of a criminal conviction are far more severe at the federal level than they are at the state level and if you are found guilty of a serious federal crime, you could end up being sentenced to years or decades in federal prison. For the most egregious federal offenses, the punishment handed down by the court may include life imprisonment or possibly even the death penalty.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"\/\">Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers<\/a>, our criminal defense lawyers know how devastating a conviction would be for you and your loved ones and we promise to fight for your rights, your freedom and your future every step of the way.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Tips for Hiring the Right Defense Attorney<\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Make sure you choose the right kind of lawyer.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The criminal justice system in the United States is made up of two distinct areas: federal criminal law and state criminal law. The federal criminal justice system is very different from the state criminal justice system in California, and an attorney who only has experience defending clients against state charges will not be anywhere near ready to defend you against your federal charges.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike a state case, which is prosecuted in state court by a District Attorney (prosecuting attorney), a federal case is prosecuted in federal court by an Assistant U.S. Attorney (federal prosecutor). Sentencing in the two types of cases is also different. The punishment in state cases is determined by state law and may include a county jail or state prison sentence, while the sentences handed down by a federal court are dictated by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which impose harsh penalties upon convicted offenders, often including a federal prison sentence. No matter what federal charges you are facing, do yourself a huge favor and make sure you choose a <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/\">federal defense attorney<\/a> who is licensed and qualified to represent your defense.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Look for a lawyer who has experience handling federal cases like yours.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The worst mistake you can make in obtaining legal counsel for your federal case is hiring the first lawyer to return your call. Sure, you are nervous about being targeted by the government for an alleged federal crime and you want to get your case underway. And it does help to get an attorney working on your case as quickly as possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to take the time to find a lawyer who has relevant experience in the area of the law that pertains to your case. Your entire future could be on the line if you are facing criminal charges in federal court and you will want to do everything you can to set yourself up for success.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that no attorney worth his salt will guarantee you a specific result. That being said, if you have been arrested or charged with a federal drug offense, you want a defense attorney in your corner who has a proven record of success defending clients against federal drug charges. If you are facing criminal charges for money laundering, you need a lawyer who has experience handling white-collar crimes. You can find this information by researching the lawyer online and\/or asking him about his experience. The federal government is a formidable adversary and your attorney\u2019s expertise will go a long way towards helping you get the best possible outcome in your case. Here are some questions you can consider asking:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How long have you practiced criminal law?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How often do you appear in federal court?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How often have you appeared in the court where my case will be heard?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How often do your cases go to trial?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 When was the last time you appeared in federal court? What was the case?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Have you ever represented a client in a case like mine?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 What is your success rate?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Do you have any testimonials from past clients I can read?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Will you be the one working on my case?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 What strategy would you propose for handling my case?<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Find out how much the lawyer you are considering will cost.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Hiring an attorney can get expensive. At the beginning of the process, you have no idea how long your case may take to resolve and how costly your financial obligation may end up being. Quality legal representation takes time and that time can add up quickly. Once you narrow down your list to a few potential attorneys, be upfront about what you can afford and ask direct questions about how you would be charged if you were to hire the firm.<\/p>\n<p>Some lawyers charge by the hour and others charge a flat fee. Federal criminal cases tend to be fairly complex and depending on the nature of your charge, one or the other pricing structure may be more beneficial to you. Before you make any kind of commitment, make sure you understand how the lawyer will figure out your fee. Keep in mind that many law firms offer a no-cost initial consultation and we highly recommend taking advantage of that offer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"menu-what-to-do-first-container\">\n<ul id=\"menu-what-to-do-first\" class=\"menu\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-charges\/\">What to do First<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/hire-federal-lawyer\/\">Hire a Federal Attorney<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-investigations\/\">Involved in a Federal Investigation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/arrested-by-federal-agents\/\">Arrested by a Federal Agent<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-agents-home-visit\/\">Search Warrant<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/receive-target-letter\/\">Received a Target Letter<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Schedule an initial consultation.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>At Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers, we offer prospective clients a free case evaluation, during which you have the opportunity to discuss your case with our defense team with no obligation to hire our firm.
