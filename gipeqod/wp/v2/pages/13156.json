The key element of a drug conspiracy charge is the underlying criminal agreement to violate a federal drug law, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>\n<p>Although many drug conspiracy cases involve an express or explicit agreement, the federal government may be able to pursue criminal charges for drug conspiracy even if the alleged criminal agreement was implicit or implied. In other words, if, based on the circumstances, it is clear that the participants committed or planned to commit a crime, even if they didn\u2019t state their intention explicitly, it may be enough for drug conspiracy charges to stand.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, conspiracy charges can apply even if the crime was never committed; simply knowing that an agreement existed and joining the agreement exposes you to drug conspiracy charges.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Drug Conspiracy \u2013 21 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 963<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>According to the Department of Justice, the federal drug conspiracy statute (21 U.S. Code \u00a7 846), which is separate from the general conspiracy statute (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 371), makes it a crime to conspire to violate or attempt to violate any substantive offense set forth in 21 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 801-904 (Control and Enforcement). Section 963 of Title 21 makes it a crime to conspire to violate or attempt to violate any substantive offense set forth in 21 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 951-971 (Import and Export). <b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Types of Drug Conspiracy Charges<\/h2>\n<p>The main statutes that deal with federal drug crimes in the United States are 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 841 (drug manufacturing and drug distribution\/trafficking) and 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 952 (drug importation). Because being involved in a conspiracy means joining an agreement to violate a federal law, drug conspiracy charges generally break down into four different categories based on the applicable drug law:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022<b> Conspiracy to manufacture a controlled substance<\/b> \u2013 Participating in any part of the drug manufacturing process (i.e. growing or processing)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Conspiracy to distribute or traffic a controlled substance<\/b> \u2013 Delivering an illicit drug or controlled substance to another person<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Conspiracy to import a controlled substance<\/b> \u2013 Bringing an illicit drug or controlled substance into the United States<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it<\/b> \u2013 Having in your possession a large enough quantity of a drug that it seems likely you intended to sell it<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Drug Conspiracy Penalties<\/h2>\n<p>Like most federal drug crimes, the penalties associated with involvement in a drug conspiracy depend on the type and quantity of the drug in question and are equal to the penalties associated with the target crime. At stated in 21 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 963, \u201cAny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you are accused of conspiring to manufacture or distribute one kilogram or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, a violation of 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 846, you could face a potential punishment consisting of not less than 10 years or more than life in prison, plus a fine of $10 million (individual) or $50 million (group or organization).<\/p>\n<p>Similar to other <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-drug-cases\/\">federal drug crimes<\/a>, you could face enhanced criminal penalties for drug conspiracy if you have a prior felony conviction for a drug crime or if someone dies or suffers serious bodily injury as a result of using the drug involved in the alleged conspiracy. Drug conspiracy charges can also result in the seizure and forfeiture of your property and assets if the government can show that the property and assets were obtained as a result of a drug-related crime or that you used or intended to use the property or assets to commit or facilitate a drug crime.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Drug Conspiracy Prosecution<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike other drug crimes, for which there are several complex elements the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to get a conviction, a drug conspiracy case requires proof of only two main points:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 That there was an agreement between two or more people to violate a federal drug law, and<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 That the alleged conspirators knew of the agreement and joined it.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to note that alleged conspirators do not have to know all the details of the agreement, nor do they have to know all of the conspirators for drug conspiracy charges to be filed. They do, however, have to know and agree to the basic purpose of the agreement, i.e. to violate a federal drug law.<\/p>\n<p>Also important is the fact that while the general federal conspiracy statute (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 371) requires proof of an overt act committed by one conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, the federal drug conspiracy statute (21 U.S. Code \u00a7 846) does not. That means you can face charges for drug conspiracy simply by entering into an agreement to commit a drug-related crime, whether you take action to carry out the target crime or not.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Possible Defenses to Conspiracy Charges <\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Drug conspiracy charges are serious, but with the right legal strategy and an experienced defense attorney on your side, it is possible to have the charges reduced or possibly even dismissed altogether. Even though there are only two main elements to a drug conspiracy charge, these elements must still be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>If your attorney can successfully challenge the prosecution\u2019s evidence against you and raise reasonable doubts in the minds of the jurors that you are guilty of the crime, you may be able to secure an acquittal at trial. The following are some possible defenses your attorney may use in your federal drug conspiracy case:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 A conspiracy did not exist (there was no agreement)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You did not intend to join the agreement<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You withdrew from the conspiracy<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You were involved in a different conspiracy<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You were the victim of an illegal search and seizure<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You were entrapped by federal agents<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You prevented the success of the conspiracy (renunciation)<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 You agreed to commit an act, but the act is not a crime<\/p>\n<h2>Types of Drug Cases<\/h2>\n<div id=\"nav_menu-7\" class=\"widget widget_nav_menu\">\n<div class=\"heading\">\n<h4 class=\"widget-title fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" data-fontsize=\"22\" data-lineheight=\"33.4333px\">Drug Cases<\/h4>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"menu-drug-cases-container\">\n<ul id=\"menu-drug-cases\" class=\"menu\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/federal-drug-cases\/\">Federal Drug Cases<\/a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/murder-homicide-charges\/\">Murder \/ Homicide Charges<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-conspiracy-charges\/\">Drug Conspiracy Charges<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-distribution\/\">Drug Distribution<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-importation-or-exportation\/\">Drug Importation or Exportation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-manufacturing\/\">Drug Manufacturing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-smuggling\/\">Drug Smuggling<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/drug-trafficking\/\">Drug Trafficking<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/rico-cases\/\">RICO Cases<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Why You Need a Criminal Defense Attorney<\/h2>\n<p>Drug conspiracy is a powerful tool used by the federal government to punish co-conspirators accused of agreeing to commit a drug crime, even in cases where the alleged target crime remains unfinished. In fact, in many drug conspiracy cases, the other party in the deal or transaction is a cooperating witness or a law enforcement officer, in which case, it was likely factually impossible that the drug crime would have occurred in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the federal drug conspiracy statute gives the government the authority to file charges against the would-be offender, as well as any other members of the conspiracy, known as \u201cco-conspirators,\u201d even if they were not major participants in the conspiracy.<\/p>\n<p>Standing up against the federal government and defending yourself against drug conspiracy charges is no easy task, especially when there is so much on the line.
