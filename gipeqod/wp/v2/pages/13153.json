The federal government has extensive resources at its disposal to investigate, charge and prosecute homicides that violate federal law and an arrest or indictment for federal murder is quite literally a matter of life and death.<\/p>\n<p>Federal murder cases often involve killings that are related to federal drug crimes, such as drug trafficking or drug smuggling, but they can also involve any killing committed during the course of a felony, such as kidnapping, arson or bank robbery, or any other killing that violates federal law. Federal homicide is an extremely serious criminal charge, punishable by life in prison or the death penalty in the most serious cases.

In the United States, there is a hierarchy of criminal acts that are known collectively as homicide. First-degree murder is the most serious type of homicide, followed by second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter, in order of seriousness.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Murder Defined<\/h2>\n<p>The main statute that covers federal murder crimes in the United States is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1111, which defines murder as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.\u201d The statute recognizes two categories of murder, which differ in terms of severity: murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. According to the law, first-degree murder is any murder \u201cperpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or <a href=\"https:\/\/federalcriminaldefenselawyers.com\/federal-defense\/sex-crimes\/\">sexual abuse<\/a>, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed.\u201d Every other kind of murder is considered second-degree murder.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Penalties for Federal Murder Charges<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Federal murder is one of the most serious crimes you can be accused of committing in the United States and the punishment for federal murder is unsurprisingly severe. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1111, murder in the first degree is punishable by death or a life sentence in federal prison, while murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment in federal prison for any term of years or for life.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Federal Manslaughter Defined<\/h2>\n<p>Compared to murder, manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice, or the intention or desire to do evil (ill will). There are two kinds of manslaughter (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1112) recognized by federal law:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Voluntary manslaughter<\/b> \u2013 \u201cUpon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Involuntary manslaughter<\/b> \u2013 \u201cIn the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or in the commission in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce death.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 20; line-height: 1.45;\" data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"29px\"><b>Penalties for Federal Manslaughter Charges<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Voluntary manslaughter is a federal crime punishable by a fine and\/or imprisonment for up to 15 years in federal prison. Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by a fine and\/or imprisonment for up to eight years in federal prison.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Attempt to Commit Murder or Manslaughter<\/h2>\n<p>There is another statute that sets forth the appropriate punishment for any attempt to commit murder or manslaughter in violation of federal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1113). Under this law, any person who, \u201cwithin the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d attempts to commit murder, is subject to a fine and\/or a term of imprisonment of no more than 20 years. Any person who attempts to commit manslaughter is subject to a fine and\/or a term of imprisonment of no more than seven years.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">What is Considered Federal Murder or Homicide?<\/h2>\n<p>The majority of murder and homicide cases in California involve violations of state law and are handled by the state courts. However, there are some specific circumstances in which a murder or homicide case can be tried in federal court. For instance, the federal government has jurisdiction over murder and homicide cases that take place on federal property, as well as cases that involve a federal agency or federal official, and those that violate federal law or the Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>Any person arrested by federal agents or accused of using a federal agency, such as the U.S. Postal Service, to commit a murder or homicide can also be charged with a federal crime. In some cases, federal charges will be brought if the crime in question is particularly egregious or if the defendant has a significant criminal history. The following are some examples of cases involving a murder or homicide that can be charged as a federal offense:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder, Manslaughter or Attempted Murder or Manslaughter Against Any Officer or Employee of the U.S. \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1114<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Misconduct or Neglect of Ship Officers Resulting in Homicide \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1115<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder or Manslaughter of Foreign Officials, Official Guests or Internationally Protected Persons \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1116<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Conspiracy to Murder \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1117<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder by a Federal Prisoner \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1118<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Foreign Murder of United States Nationals \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1119<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder by Escaped Prisoners \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1120<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Killing Persons Aiding Federal Investigations or State Correctional Officers \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1121<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Killing Committed During a Bank Robbery \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1111<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Drug-Related Drive-by Shooting \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 36<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder by Mail \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder-for-Hire \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder of an Elected\/Appointed Federal Official \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351, 1751<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 A Killing Intended to Influence the Outcome of a Court Case \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Killing of an Immediate Family Member of a Law Enforcement Official \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Murder Aboard a Ship \u2013 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2280<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sevenslegal.com\/criminal-attorney\/difference-murder-manslaughter\/281\/\">To see the difference between murder and homicide click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Why You Need to Hire a Federal Murder Defense Attorney<\/h2>\n<p>Federal murder\/homicide cases are prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys, who tend to be tough on criminal defendants, and any federal agency involved in investigating the case, such as the FBI or DEA, will appear in federal court to provide testimony, which can be particularly damaging to the defendant\u2019s defense.<\/p>\n<p>The penalties resulting from a conviction in a federal homicide case can also be more severe than those associated with state homicide charges, which is one of the main reasons we recommend speaking to an experienced federal criminal defense lawyer when faced with allegations of federal murder or homicide. Choosing the right defense attorney can mean the difference between a punishment of death or imprisonment for life and walking away with your freedom intact. A good criminal defense lawyer may be able to successfully challenge a federal murder charge using one or more of the following legal defenses:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022<b> Self-defense <\/b>\u2013 You committed the killing in self-defense or in defense of others due to a reasonable belief that you or they were in imminent danger of physical harm.<\/p>\n<p><b>\u2022 Accidental killing<\/b> \u2013 You had no criminal intent to do harm, you were engaged in lawful conduct at the time the killing took place, and you were not acting negligently.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Insanity<\/b> \u2013 You were legally insane at the time the killing occurred.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022<b> Illegal search and seizure<\/b> \u2013 The evidence against you was obtained during an illegal search of your person or property.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <b>Mistaken identity <\/b>\u2013 You have been mistakenly identified as the perpetrator of a murder crime.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022<b> Lesser charges<\/b> &#8211; The killing amounted to a lesser form of homicide, such as voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.<\/p>\n<p>Introducing evidence and testimony that suggests a version of events in contradiction to the prosecution\u2019s evidence could lead to a plea bargain, a conviction on a lesser charge with a lighter sentence, or even a finding of not guilty.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"fusion-responsive-typography-calculated\" style=\"--fontsize: 32; line-height: 1.31;\" data-fontsize=\"32\" data-lineheight=\"41.92px\">Our Federal Criminal Defense Lawyers Can Help<\/h2>\n<p>If you are accused of committing a murder or homicide in violation of federal law, you could end up facing charges for federal murder, a charge that carries a lengthy term of imprisonment, possibly for life, or even the death penalty.
